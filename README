= SocialConnections

Enables

* Social connections between people and things: list of friends, things you like, stuff you recommend.
* Activities on those things which are recorded for later processing
* Digest mechanism to digest those activities, e.g. for daily digest emails.

This gem is work in progress and my playground, and currently my playground, don't use it!


== Setup

Install as a gem

  gem install social_connections

or reference in your Gemfile

  gem 'social_connections'

and run

  bundle install


Next, you need to add the migration. This works currently by executing

  rake db:migrate:social_connections

which adds the required tables.

Now, every model that is supposed to act as a connectable thing (so that friends can connect
other friend or users can like books), add to all those models

  acts_as_connectable :verbs => [ :likes, :recommends, :comments ]

where the verbs specify what you want to allow those connectables to do to other connectables.
See the example below, that may make it clearer.

== Example

TODO: Example goes here.


== How to run the Tests (in the gem itself, not in your Rails app)

Run test in ./test:

  rake

Run specs in ./spec:

  rspec spec
