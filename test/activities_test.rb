# subject, verb, object
# both subject and object are 'acts_as_connectable'
# examples:
# - tim likes idea x
# - tom comments "this is awesome" on idea y
# - ben bought deal "25% off on xyz"
#
# how to indicate that someone has seen an activity already?
# by having "owner, subject, verb, object", there could be a flag on the activity?
