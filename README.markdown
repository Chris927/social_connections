# @markup markdown
# @title Social Connections and Activity Feeds for Rails Applications

# Social Connections #

Is this proper markdown? Dunno whats going on.

Can we

* have
* a list here?

And is the following some example code?

    rake db:migrate:social_connections
    rails generate blablabla

Still playing around with this...
